# lua_code_fragments

i will not create new repo and just put a piece of code in it, i will put them all together here.

1 thread.lua

it is meant to make you use coroutine like traditional thread. it provides 'Thread.suspend' and 'Thread.resume' to replace 'coroutine.yield' and 'coroutine.resume'

2 asyncio.lua

it is similar to python asyncio and can be used to avoid callback hell
